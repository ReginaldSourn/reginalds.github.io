*Reginald* is my English name my birth name is **Rithy Sourn**. People I know mostly name Thy or Rithy or the "i" sound. So I add one more to call difference. So, I don't confuse. I'm 27 this year, but every year I'm still 22. ***Forever 22 year old!*** I studied Electronics skills at A Polytechnique Institute. But I haven't learned much. Mostly I explore knowledge from the start-up company. I worked for many start-up companies. Right now, I'm working with [VitaminAir]((https:vitaminair.org)) as an engineer. I don't think it's label right for me. But it's cool. 
I'm more into the design and new ideas. I love arts, innovations, inventions and something more creative. I'm a person who believes those passions above can drive humanity to another level or save humanity. I want to improve artisans' skills to prove myself I can do it. My best skill right now is design and programming. I will keep improving the day the earth. I will keep improving those skills until my last day on earth.
