**" You do not love yourself enough. Or No great thing is you would love your nature too, and what it demands of you. "**
~ *Marcus Aurelius*.

Today is a two-day. Today I have been living on earth for almost 9338 days already. In 2022, I can say it is my awful year and my beautiful year. I have lost myself for so many years, and this year I was found. This January, I was in bed with depression and anxiety. 
I wonder what I have been doing wrong in life. One month passed, I diagnosed myself have ADHD. Thanks to Jessica McCabe was in TedX.

 She shared her experience with ADHD. That allows me to know I am not alone who suffering from that experience. I have done something that is not good for my inner-self. It makes me feel ashamed, guilty, sad, and depressed. I thought maybe I was a broken person. After I was diagnosed with that disorder, I felt more relief. I am not a fraud or loser. I can be myself that have neurodiversity. I should love and be proud of myself that I represent as a human. My skill can help humanity. What I should do is do what I can. Why do I need to be put pressure on myself to be someone that I can not be?


So, I decided to say NO to something I am not want to do.
Careful to say Yes to something to someone. For my sake and the others. I should be a happy person.

So grateful that I have great people as friends and advisors. Thanks to friends and family that support me and give me time and space. Without it, I can not have time to do self-reflection and fall too deep into a rabbit hole. Or, keep it in a loop. Once *Lao Tzu* said, **"When you are content to be simply yourself and do not compare or compete, everyone will respect you."** Appreciate Everyone's life and yours.
