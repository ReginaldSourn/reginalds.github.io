Yesterday we celebrated Earth Day. Earth has been surviving an estimated 4.54 billion years from nowadays. Homos-Sapiens survive at least 250K years. As civilized Homo-Sapiens, Some people still don't understand or accept how to live in harmony with nature. We are running out of time to save ourselves, not the earth. I believe Solarpunk is a group of generations using technology, modern agriculture, art, and the right mindset to fix humankind's problems. We should encourage something that can help our children and grandchildren.

1. Bio-Energy: Enzymatic biofuel cells, bio-battery, and Artificial Photosynthesis are the technologies for sustainable energy. We can build assisting tools like humanoids, electric cars, and many technologies that live and die, not piling harmful waste on our planets. Another thing, we don't need to dig minerals from the earth either. Imagine if we can help Mars with that technology and turn it into Earth 2.0.

2. Urban Farming: Industrial Vertical farming Rooftop- gardening, guerilla gardening helps us slow down the plastic waste of transportation, decrease CO2 from the air in the city, and we don't need to disturb forests to grow our food. Leave the forest as a place full of adventure and discovery for the next generations.

3. Build Ethical Cults in the community: All humans do worship something. We have traditional cults, culty-cult, and Ethical Cults. An ethical Cult is a culture in which no submissions of the self to anybody or anything, Valorizations of self as a sovereign individual, and connecting collective emergence intelligence. We take responsibility for our development and empowerment, and We need to accept our power without apology. Want to know more watch Why the world needs cults by Jamie Wheal.

4. Embrace Diversity and Remove discriminations: As an individual, we need to remove discriminations mindsets in ourselves to see the world's equality and equity. If we want to build a beautiful community full of love, We need to accept diversity. Because everything has its purpose, and everything that happens in our life remains has its reasons. That's why we need to build ethicals cults for ourselves and our community. We need to surrender ourselves to nature.

Those messages above sound not easy to be done. But I believe #SolarPunk is generations have a strong mindset and has the skill to make those things above done. No matter what the world will be. Dystopian and Utopians, Solarpunk will grow green in their world and keep the right mindset within themselves.
